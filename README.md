CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION:

What This Project is about? We have a large number of 64x64 images and this project has to find out whether or not driver is driving in safe ,moderate or unsafe zone . In this project, I applied some of the performance optimization techniques to the real-world problem of classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Application : This project can be used to alarm the driver when he is driving in unsafe zone for long time .
